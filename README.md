```
In SQL, the SUM command is used to calculate the sum of values in a specific column. It is often used in conjunction with the SELECT statement to retrieve the total sum of a numeric column in a table.

Here's a basic syntax for using the SUM command:
SELECT SUM(column_name) AS total_sum
FROM table_name;
Explanation:

SUM(column_name): Specifies the column for which you want to calculate the sum.
AS total_sum: Assigns an alias to the result, making it easier to reference in the output.

Example:
Let's say you have a table named sales with a column named amount representing the sales amount. You can use the SUM command to find the total sales amount:

SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM sales;

This query will return a single value, which is the sum of all values in the `amount` column, labeled as `total_sales`.
